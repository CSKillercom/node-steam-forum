The goal of this forum is to create a place where people can discuss various Steam-related JS libs and learn how to use them.

If you have trouble using any of Steam-related module for Node.js, this repo's [Issues](https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum/issues) is the best place to ask for help. Please, be considerate, don't expect that anyone will code everything for you.

Be polite. Be efficient.

If you have trouble understanding READMEs or examples of modules, perhaps you [don't know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/) good enough. JavaScript is a language decievably easy to start with, but many (especially client-side) programmers rarely use it to its full potential. However, Node.js programming actually requires to understand and use most of the JavaScript techniques. So, [learn](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/)! It is well worth your time.
